# Lab3-Cs245-

Time complexity is bigO of n squared. Because of the for loops. The space complexity is bigO of n because the largest thing I am keeping is an array of size n. 

The Main method is where you run the code. I created a Sortcolumns just like you asked. Created a loop to output -1 for specific scenarios, like you asked in the lab.
